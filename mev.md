### Analysing transactions
For analyzing transactions, there's no better tool than @eth_tx. It produces full event logs, call traces, and state mutations. Open source too.
Try to avoid Etherscan's default txn view, it can be misleading and misrepresent what happened.

### Testing
For testing, I recommend @dapptools. You can test your bot against a forked version of mainnet, override storage slots, write tests in solidity, symbolically execute code, and run fuzz tests. Absolutely amazing.
